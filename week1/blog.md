## A2A protocol architecture
Agent2Agent protocol is a communication protocol for AI agents

- Agent cards: This JSON file outlines agentic AI metadata and can be accessed using a URL. It contains basic info about an agent,
  including its name, description, version, service endpoint URL, supported modalities or data types and authetication requirements.
- Task model: The Task model defines the structured schema of a unit of work exchanged between agents in the A2A protocol.
  It has a unique ID and progresses through a lifecycle
  of defined states (submitted, working, input-required, completed, failed). Tasks are useful for multi-turn processing or long-running
  agent-to-agent collaboration.
- Artifact model: The Artifact model defines the structured output generated by an agent upon completing a Task. It can be a document,
  image, spreadsheet or any other deliverable.Like messages, artifacts consist of one or more parts and can be incrementally streamed.
- Message model: The Message model defines the structured communication unit exchanged between agents during task execution.
  Messages relay answers, context, instructions, prompts, questions, replies and status updates. Depending on the sender, each message
  has an associated role, which can either be an agent role for server-sent messages or a user role for client-sent messages.
- capability discovery： Capability discovery is the mechanism by which a Host Agent identifies and selects appropriate agents to perform
  a given task. The capability discovery process typically follows these steps:

1. The Host Agent retrieves Agent Cards from a registry or catalog.
2. The Host Agent analyzes the declared skills and metadata.
3. It matches the task requirements with the most suitable agent.
4. The selected agent receives a structured Task.

This enables dynamic, plug-and-play multi-agent orchestration without hardcoded routing.
Capability discovery is a key feature of A2A because it allows agents built in different languages or frameworks to interoperate in a 
distributed system.



## A2A vs MCP
Model Context Protocol(MCP) serves as a standardization layer for AI applications to communicate effectively with external services, 
such as APIs (application programming interfaces), data sources, predefined functions and other tools. Meanwhile, the A2A protocol 
focuses on agent collaboration, facilitating communication between AI agents.
MCP focuses on vertical integration — enabling a single LLM or agent to connect with external tools, data sources, and services.
Use MCP when: A single LLM needs access to databases, APIs, or internal systems; You want to standardize tool access across multiple LLMs;
You need structured context injection from external sources; You want to solve the N*M integration problem between models and systems.
MCP is used for agent-to-tool(LLM-to-system) communication.
MCP focuses on vertical integration — enabling a single LLM or agent to connect with external tools, data sources, and services.
Use A2A when: Multiple agents need to collaborate on task; Tasks require delegation and coordination; You want dynamic capability discovery
between agents； You want dynamic capability discovery between agents; Workflows are distributed across specialized agents.
